# Remaining tasks

- [x] WEB-001: Boss attacks (melee) should show as red dots on the aggro target
- [x] WEB-002: Implement exact Time Lapse behavior for spells `23310`, `23311`, `23312` with the legacy target-threat scaling model.
- [x] WEB-003: Validate and port remaining SoD paladin talent interactions (`Improved Righteous Fury`, `Vengeance`) from upstream.
